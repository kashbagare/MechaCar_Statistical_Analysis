From the results of the linear regression, it is clear that the vehicle length and the ground clearance are more likely to provide a non-random amount of variance to the data set while the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD are more likely to provide a random amount of variance to the data set. 

From the results, we can see that the p-value is 5.35e-11 which is lower than the significance level of 0.05. This means we reject our null hypothesis which also means that the slope of the linear regression is NOT zero. 

Given that the Multiple R-Squared value is about 71%, this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes relatively effectively.
